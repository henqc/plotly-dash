## About the Dashboard

This dashboard was created for a persona who is named Lisa. Lisa is a graduate film student interested in the trends in films over time. This dashboard allows Lisa to be able to
quickly view relevant data movies without having too much trouble navigating through the dashboard. Lisa will be able to see how the distribution of IMDb ratings evolves over time
or for some given genres. She will be able to tell which genres perform form better on average over the years. She will also be able to tell how well a film is performing in terms of its gross as compared to other films that received the same rating. This can lead to insight into which movies received more hype versus which movies captured their audience. Lisa will also be able to view trends in given genres over time. She will be able to see which genres have the most top movies and make educated inferences from this. This dashboard will help
Lisa looks at the analytical side of movies and helps her make educated choices in the future when she is producing her movies.

## Building Process

When building this dashboard, I first planned out what my customers needed. Then I planned out a layout and ensured that it met the requirements of my persona. I then had to collect data from an online resource and clean it so that it was ready for processing and graphing. Once the data was cleaned, I was able to use Plotly and dash to create interactive graphs with the cleaned data. Along the way, I learned about the importance of removing columns with a lot of missing or irrelevant data. This ensures the data is easy to use and will yield continuous graphs that are more intuitive and appealing. I also had to identify columns which are meant to be interpreted as integers but had characters in them so I had to use string manipulation methods to put the columns in the expected format and cast them to the appropriate type.
