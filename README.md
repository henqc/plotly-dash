## About the Dashboard

This dashboard was created for a persona who is named Lisa. Lisa is a graduate film student interested the trends in films over time. This dashboard allows Lisa to be able to
quickly view relevant data movies without hasving too much trouble navigating through the dashboard. Lisa will be able to see how the distribution of IMDb ratings evolve over time
or for some given genres. She will be able to tell which genres perform form better on average over the years. She will also be able to tell how well a film is performing in terms of its gross as compared to other films that received the same rating. This can lead to insight on which movies received more hype versus which movies capture their audience. Lisa will also be able to view trends in given genres over time. She will be able to see which genres have the most top movies and make educated inferences off this. This dashboard will help
Lisa look at the analytical side of movies and help her make educated choices in the future when she is producing her own movies.

## Building Process

When building this dashboard, I first planned out what my customer needed. Then I planned out a layout and ensured that it met the requirements of my persona. I then had to collect data from an online resource and clean it so that it was ready for processing and graphing. Once the data was cleaned, I was able to use plotly and dash to create interactive graphs with the cleaned data. Along the way I learned about the importance of removing columns with a lot of missing or irrelevant data. This ensures the data is easy to use and will yield continuous graphs which are more intuitive and appealing. I also had to identify columns which are meant to be interperted as integers but had characters in them so I had to use string manipulation methods to put the columns in expected format and cast it to the appropirate type.
